; --master - The master uWSGI process is necessary to gracefully re-spawn and pre-fork workers, consolidate logs,
; and manage many other features (shared memory, cron jobs, worker timeoutsâ€¦). Without this feature on,
; uWSGI is a mere shadow of its true self.
;
; --vacuum - This option will instruct uWSGI to clean up any temporary files or UNIX sockets it created,
; such as HTTP sockets, pidfiles, or admin FIFOs.
